Using a text editor like Vim or Nano:

`nano file.txt`
---------------
This will open the Nano text editor in the terminal, where you can manually enter the two strings 
and save the file. In Nano, you can save the file with the key combination Ctrl + O, and exit with 
Ctrl + X. In Vim, you can enter insert mode with the i key, enter the text, and save and exit with 
the command :wq.
